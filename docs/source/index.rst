What is ganetimgr?

Installation
############
You can go through the installation at the :doc:`Install ganetimgr <install>` section.

Upgrading
#########
If running an older version, look through the :doc:`Upgrade Notes <upgrade>` before upgrading to a new one.

Compatibility
#############
ganetimgr has been tested with ganeti versions 2.4-2.15. Due to the nature of the Ganeti RAPI, ganetimgr should be able to communicate with any Ganeti v.2.X cluster.

While most of the functionality is available with vanila Ganeti setups, there are some features that require changes to Ganeti in order to work properly, see :doc:`Ganeti Patches <ganeti>`
